Winter HPC at JAX is a GPU-based computing cluster and it is powered by [NVIDIA(r) V100 series](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/v100/) GPU cards. If you are working on GPU-based HPC or linux env, following page should guide you on setting up commonly used GPU libraries, e.g., [Tensorflow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/about/), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
