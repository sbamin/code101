This website uses cookies, in particular, [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) to monitor your one-time or repeated visits and page visit behavior. These cookies also measure relevant sections and pages of website which are frequently or rarely visited, e.g., using user-defined search keywords, and thus help me optimize contents and relevant meta data to make this documentation better.

However, disabling these cookies should not render this website non-functional.
