My notes on programming, mostly using R, Python, and bash.

### Using mkdocs

This site is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org). It uses [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme and several extensions. To build local version of this documentation, you can install/upgrade following python packages, preferably in clean conda or virtual env.

```
pip install --upgrade mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-git-revision-date-plugin  mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin mkdocs-minify-plugin pymdown-extensions mkdocs-macros-plugin
```
